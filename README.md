arma-ui-editor
==============

If you're interested, fork this and don't push back to this repo, I've abandoned this. :-)

Also try to honor the licence (GPL v2). If you really don't want to open source whatever you're making of this
then contact me, I'm a very easy person. :-)

Current state:
* Can read ui config files, kinda
* displays the ui properly when loaded, kinda
* can move stuff around, kinda
